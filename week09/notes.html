        <h3>Week 09 Questions?</h3>
        <h5>Chapter 09 The window Object</h5>
        <li>The Browser Object Model (or BOM for short) is a collection of properties and methods that contain information about the browser and computer screen. <br> For example, we can find out which browser is being used to view a page (though, this method
            is unreliable). We can also find out the dimensions of the screen it is viewed on, and which pages have been visited before the current page.</li>
        <li>If you don’t know the name of the global object, you can also refer to it using the keyword this in the global scope. The following code provides a <br> quick way of assigning the variable global to the global object: <br>// from within the global
            scope
            <br> const global = this;</li>
        <li>you should refer to global variables without using the window object; it’s less typing and your code will be more portable between environments. An exception is if you need to check whether a global variable has been defined.</li>
        <li>The window.alert() method will pause the execution of the program and display a message in a dialog box.</li>
        <li>The window.confirm() method will stop the execution of the program and display a confirmation dialog that shows the message provided as an argument, and giving the options of OK or Cancel. </li>
        <li>The window.prompt() method will stop the execution of the program. It displays a dialog that shows a message provided as an argument, as well as an input field that allows the user to enter text.</li>
        <li>The window.location property is an object that contains information about the URL of the current page. It contains a number of properties that provide information about different fragments of the URL.</li>
        <li>The setTimeOut() and setInterval() methods can be used to animate elements on a web page.</li>

        <h5>Chapter 14 HTML5 APIs</h5>
        <li>HTML5 is the latest version of the Hypertext Markup Language used to create web pages. The latest iteration is HTML 5.1, which finally became a W3C recommendation in November 2016.</li>
        <li>The data- attribute is a way of embedding data in a web page using custom attributes that are ignored by the browser. They’re also private to a page, so are not intended to be used by an external service – their sole purpose is to be used by a
            JavaScript program.</li>
