        <h5>Chapter 10 Debugging</h5>
        <li>One of the most useful commands is the debugger keyword. This will create a breakpoint in your code that will<br> pause the execution of the code and allow you to see where the program is currently up to. You can also hover over any <br>variables
            to see what value they hold at that point. The program can then be restarted by clicking on the 'play' button.</li>

        <li>An error object can be created by the host environment when an exception occurs, or it can be created in the code using a constructor function, like so:<br> const error = new Error();</li>
        <li>JavaScript can be put into strict mode using the string "use strict" . This can be used in a whole file or just a single function.</li>
