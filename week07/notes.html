        <h3>Week 07 Questions?</h3>
        <h5>Chapter 11 Further Functions</h5>
        <li> The fact that functions are first-class objects means they can have properties and methods themselves.<br> For example, all functions have a length property that returns the number of parameters the function has.</li>
        <li>The call() method can be used to set the value of this inside a function to an object that is provided as the first argument.<br>If the function that’s called requires any parameters, these need to be provided as arguments after the first argument,
            which is always the value of this</li>
        <li>There is no way to remove a variable from a scope once it’s been declared.<br> If a variable is only required temporarily, it may cause confusion if it’s still available later in the code. Even worse, the name of the variable may clash with another
            piece of code (an external JavaScript library, for example) resulting in errors. </li>
        <li>One of the problems with simply placing 'use strict' at the beginning of a file <br>is that it will enforce strict mode on all the JavaScript in the file, and if you’re using other people’s code, there’s no guarantee that they’ve coded in strict
            mode. </li>
        (function() { <br> 'use strict';<br> // All your code would go inside this function<br> })();<br>
        <br>
        <li>A recursive function is one that invokes itself until a certain condition is met. It’s a useful tool to use when iterative processes are involved. A common example is a function that calculates thefactorialof a number:</li>
        <li> A pure function doesn't change any values or data elsewhere in the program. It only makes non-destructive data transformations and returns new values, rather than altering any of the underlying da</li>
        <h5>Chapter 13 Ajax</h5>
        <li>Ajax is a technique that allows web pages to communicate asynchronously with a server, and it dynamically updates web pages without reloading.</li>
        <li>The use of Ajax revolutionized how websites worked, and ushered in a new age of web applications. Web pages were no longer static, but dynamic applications.</li>

        <li>JavaScript was always considered a 'front-end' language, not used to communicate with the server.<br> Ajax enabled JavaScript to send requests and receive responses from a server, allowing content to be updated in real time.</li>

        <li>JSON is probably the most common format for AJAX responses. The json() method is used to deal with these by transforming a stream of JSON data into a promise that resolves to a JavaScript object.</li>
        fetch(url)<br> .then( response => response.json() ); // transforms the JSON data into a JavaScript object<br> .then( data => console.log(Object.entries(data)) )<br> .catch( error => console.log('There was an error: ', error))<br>
        <li>In the example below, the Object.entries() method is used to view the key and value pairs in the returned object.</li>
