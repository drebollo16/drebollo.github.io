        <h4>Week 01 Questions?</h4>
        <li>The reading assignments will be from the 5 different books on sitepoint?</li>
        <li>Every week we will be going over different readings and not in order?</li>
        <h4>Week 02 Questions?</h4>
        <li>We were working on the callback, arrow function => for the assignment. I wanted to know what are the main points using arrow function? We worked with it and added the other functions to the assignment.<br> I did not see much difference with callback
            and other functions that are available. I felt it confused me more, and It is probably easier to use. </li>
        <li>Going over the chapter 3 of Arrays, I never knew we could use mixed arrays and the book provided an example. <br> const mixedArray = [ null, 1, [], 'two', true ];</li>
        <h4>Week 03 Questions?</h4>
        <li>We went over Arrays this week and using the Javascript version of arrays is new. I never knew there so many different ways to use it. Doing the assignment with my team
            <br> helped me to understand more. on problem 8 using the reduce function, I am still understanding about sort function, map and
            <br> I did not know you could use that in arrays. <br> The book talks about weak maps, and weak sets I really have no clue how they work. I know this are so many ways to program code to work the same way.
