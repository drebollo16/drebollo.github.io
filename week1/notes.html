        <h4>Week 01 Questions?</h4>
        <li>The reading assignments will be from the 5 different books on sitepoint?</li>
        <li>Every week we will be going over different readings and not in order?</li>
         <h4>Week 02 Questions?</h4>
        <li>We were working on the callback, arrow function => for the assignment. I wanted to know what are the main points using arrow function? We worked with it and added the other functions to the assignment.<br> I did not see much difference with callback
            and other functions that are available. I felt it confused me more, and It is probably easier to use. </li>
        <li>Going over the chapter 3 of Arrays, I never knew we could use mixed arrays and the book provided an example. <br>
        const mixedArray = [ null, 1, [], 'two', true ];</li>
